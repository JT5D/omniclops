# Introduction #

Here's how you can make an inexpensive omnidirectional vision system using a webcam and easily available materials.

# Parts #

Here's what you'll need:

  * A webcam.  This should be USB Video Class (UVC) compliant to ensure that it can be used on Linux.  It should also have a narrow field of view (most, but not all, webcams do)
  * A length of 5mm diameter aluminium tubing
  * A silver (reflective) Christmas tree baubel, approximately 60mm diameter (although other sizes could be used)
  * Some cardboard
  * Tie wraps
  * Pliers
  * A bradawl or screwdriver
  * Scissors
  * A drill

# Instructions #

1.  Pull the top off of the Christmas baubel, then drill a 5mm diameter hole at the opposite end.

2.  Push the aluminium tube through the holes on either side of the baubel, then crimp and bend the end of the tube so that it prevents the baubel from slipping off.

3.  Using pliers, bend the tubing into a frame like this:

The height of the frame should be about 160mm.

4.  Remove the outer casing from the webcam.  You may need a precision screwdriver to do this, and how you do it really depends upon the specific model.

5.  Cut a piece of cardboard larger than the triangle shape of the frame.

6.  Use the bradawl or screwdriver to make holes in the cardboard, then fix the webcam onto the cardboard using tie wraps threaded through the holes.

7.  Lay the cardboard over the triangle of the frame and make holes so that you can tie wrap it down.  Make sure that the camera is pointing at the centre of the baubel.  A good way to do this is to run the camera and adjust the position as needed.

8.  Trim off any excess cardboard using scissors.

The final result should look something like this:

The under side looks like this:

It's also a good idea to tie wrap the camera cable onto the frame, so that it can't get pulled out as it's moved around.

For a more professional system you could use plywood or sheet aluminium rather than cardboard.
